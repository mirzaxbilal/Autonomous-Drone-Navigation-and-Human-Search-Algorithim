# Autonomous-Drone-Navigation-and-Human-Search-Algorithim
This project features an autonomous drone simulation in Gazebo, designed to follow a series of user-defined waypoints, detect human presence using YOLO (You Only Look Once), capture images upon detection, and log the coordinates of detected humans in a CSV file. The simulation leverages ROS Noetic for communication and control
